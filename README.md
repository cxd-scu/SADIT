# Introduction


**SADIT** is the acronym of Systematic Anomaly Detection of Internet Traffic. The motivation of SADIT is to make the comparison and the validation of the Internet anomaly detection algorithms super easy. It addresses this problem from the following two perspectives:

- Facilitating the data generation
- Providing a standard library of anomaly detection algorithms

If you are a researcher interested in Internet Anomaly Detection, we
strongly encourage you to implement your algorithms following the APIs
and data format of SADIT so that you can easily compare your methods
with the existing algorithms in SADIT. Your help will be highly appreciated
if you can contribute your own algorithm(s) to the algorithms library of
SADIT. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

### What's New in Version 1.1.1

 -  **Wrap the Detector Module as Sub-Package [GAD](https://github.com/hbhzwj/GAD) (General Anomaly Detector)**: If you are merely interested in detection rathan than
    both simulated network traffic data generation and anomaly detection, then you may only need to install [GAD](https://github.com/hbhzwj/GAD). 


### What's New in Version 1.1

 -   **More Flexible Configuration Script**: You can set
     parameters in a separate configuration script and specify it with `-c`
     option.
 -   **Generation of Traffic for Dynamic Network**: The distribution of
     flow traffic and the arrival rate can change with time.
 -   **Robust Anomaly Detection Method**: A new anomaly detection algorithm that
     can work robustly in dynamic network environment has been added.
 -   **Faster Data Access Speed**: Using `numpy.array` to store data
     instead of list of list, which accelerates the data processing significantly.
 -   **Separable Check Data and Reference Data Files**
 -   **Better Structure of Classes**
  
### What's New in Version 1.0


Version 1.0 is a result of big refactor of Version 0.0. The refactor
makes the code more scalable and less buggy. 

- **Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm**: The **Configure** module and **Detector**
module have been rewritten under object-oriented paradigm. In Version
0.0, all modules depend on the global settings file `setting.py`, rendering the code more vulunerable to bugs. In this version only a few scripts
depend on `settings.py`. Classes are widely used to reduce the need to
pass parameters around. In case that parameters passing is required,
well-defined structures are used. 

- **More Flexible Experiments**: A new folder `ROOT/Experiment` appears to contain different experiments. You can write
your own experiment scripts  and put them in this folder. 

- **Better Sensitivity Analysis**: In Version 0.0, sensitivity analysis is done
by changing the global `settings.py` file and rerunning the simulation. Since
`settings.py` is a typical python module, changing it during the run is
really not a good idea. In this version, a special experiment is designed
to support sensitivity analysis.

# Structure


SADIT consists of two parts. The first part is a collection of
anomaly detection algorithms. The second part is a labeled flow record
generator. The following sections will describe them accordingly.

### Collection of Anomaly Detection Algorithms

All the detection algorithms locate in the `ROOT/Detector/gad/Detector` folder:

 -   **SVMDetector.py** contains two SVM-based anomaly detection
     algorithmes: 
     - SVM Temporal Detector
     - SVM Flow-by-Flow Detector

 -   **StoDetector.py** contains two anomaly detection algorithms (model-free and model-based) based
     on the Large Deviation Theory.
 -   **RobustDetect.py** contains an algorithm that works robustly under
     dynamic network environment.

### Labeled Flow Records Generator

Labeled Flow Records Generator consists of a **Configurer** and a
**Simulator**. The **Simulator** part is essentially a revised [fs-simulator](http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf),
developed by researchers at UW Madison. The **Configurer** first generates a
flow specification (DOT format) file with certain types of anomalies,
and then the **Simulator** will generate flow records with labels.

#### Configurer

The **Configurer** generates the corresponding DOT file according to
descriptions of user behaviour. The important concepts in **Configurer**
are as follows:

 -   **Generator**: Descriptions of a certain type of flow traffic. For
     example, **Harpoon** generator represents [harpoon
     flows](http://cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/harpoon/).
 -   **Behaviour**: Descriptions of temporal pattern. There are three typical
     types of behaviours: 
     + **Normal** behaviour is described by start time and duration. 
     + **I.I.D.** behaviour has a list of possible states, but one state will be
       selected as the current state every *t* seconds according to a certain
       probability distribution. 
     + **Markovian** behaviour assumes that states at different times are not independent and
       identically distributed, but form a Markov process.

 -   **Modulator**: Combination of **Behaviour** and **Generator**; i.e.,
     descriptions of generator behaviours. There are three types of
     modulators, corresponding to the three behaviours described above.

 -   **Node**: Host in the network, with `modulator_list` attributes.
 -   **Edge**: Channel connecting two network nodes, with `delay` and `capacity`
     attributes.
 -   **Network**: A collection of network nodes and edges.
 -   **Anomaly**: Descriptions of anomalies. When an anomaly is
     injected into the network, some attributes in the network (**Node**,
     **Edge**) will be changed.

#### Simulator

Simulator is basically a revised version of [fs-simulator](https://github.com/jsommers/fs). We have added
support to exporting anomalous flows (with label information).


# Installation

SADIT can be installed on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (through cygwin) with python 2.7. However, we strongly recommend the debian-based OS, e.g., Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, or 16.04, for which we have prepared a one-command installation script. We recommend using Anaconda2 as the Python environment; conda has a good ability to manage external packages.

To be specific, if you are working on Ubuntu, then proceed as follows:

1. Change the working directory to where you want to install SADIT, create a new folder `sadit`, and then type:

 `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/hbhzwj/SADIT.git sadit/`

2. Change the working directory to be `sadit/install`, and then type:

 `sadit/install$ sudo sh debian.sh` 


For general installation instructions, see the **Installation** section of the older version of [README](https://github.com/hbhzwj/SADIT/blob/develop/README.md). 

NOTE: We have encountered cases where a user still can not run the `sim` experiments after running Step 2 above; possible causes could be: one or more packages that [fs simulator](https://github.com/jsommers/fs) depends on are still missing. In such cases, you might need to manually add them to the `Simulator` folder. As a straightforward alternative, you could replace your `Simulator` folder using the `Simulator` folder contained in [this release](https://github.com/hbhzwj/SADIT/archive/v1.2.tar.gz).


# Usage

First, you need to specify the environment variable `SADIT_ROOT` in Bash. To do this, again, assuming you are working on Ubuntu, then, change the working directory to be your home folder, open the file `.profile` therein and add the following content: 

`export SADIT_ROOT='<path_of_your_sadit_installation>'`

For instance, my path of `sadit` installation is `/home/jzh/Dropbox/Git/sadit`, so, at the end of the file `.profile`, I added

`export SADIT_ROOT='/home/jzh/Dropbox/Git/sadit'`

Alternatively, you may also specify the above content (`export SADIT_ROOT=<path_of_your_sadit_installation>`) each time in the terminal when asked to.

Now, you are ready to use SADIT. Assume `sadit` is your working directory from now on.

To get general help message, just type

`sadit$ ./cmdsadit -h`
 
Then, you will see the following:

```
usage: cmdsadit [--profile PROFILE] [-h] [experiment]

sadit

positional arguments:
  experiment         type ./cmdsadit <exper> -h for help of an experiment;
                     available experiments are [botnet_detection_eval | detect
                     | detectbatch | detectcompare | detectrealtime | eval |
                     guitoposim | sim | timebased_botnet_detection_eval]

optional arguments:
  --profile PROFILE  profile the program
  -h, --help         print help message and exit

  ```
  
  

`experiment` specifies the experiment you want to execute. An
experiment is actually a subcommand that has some certain functionality.

Some of the available experiments are explained as follows:
- **detect**: Detect the flow records data specified by `-d` option.
    
- **detectbatch**: Run detection algorithms with all combinations
      of parameters and output the results to a folder; helps to
      select the optimal parameters.
    
- **detectcompare**: Run several detection algorithms and save the
      intermediate results; can also load results computed before
      and show comparison figure.
- **eval**: Evaluation of the detection algorithm (calculate fpr,
      fnr, and plot the ROC curve).

- **guitoposim**: Simulate using network topology created by GUI
      topology editor.
      
- **sim**: Simulate and generate flow records.


To see the help message of a method for an experiment, just type:

`/sadit$ ./cmdsadit <exper> -m <method> -h`

For instance, if you type:

`sadit$ ./cmdsadit detect -m mfmb -h`

then you will see the following help message:

```

                        the cluster number. The avaliability of other features

Example commands:
```
./cmdsadit detect -c ./Example/DetectConfig.py -d ./test/n0_flow.txt --method='mfmb' --pic_show
./cmdsadit detect -c ./Example/DetectSQLConfig.py -d ./test/n0_flow.txt --method='mfmb' --pic_show

```
**NOTE:** *Before running these commands, you may need to change the ROOT variable accordingly in the configuration
files. You may also need to check the existence and the actual path of the data file to be imported.*


### Want to Implement Your Algorithm(s)?


#### Use the Labeled Flow Records Generated by [fs-simulator](http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf)
The generated flows will be saved in the `ROOT/Simulator` folder. The flows end with `_flow.txt`, for example, `n0_flow.txt` is the network flows through node 0. File starting with `abnormal_` is the exported abnormal flows correspondingly. 

**A typical line is**
:   `text-export n0 1348412129.925416 1348412129.925416 1348412130.070733 10.0.7.4:80->10.0.8.5:53701 tcp 0x0 n1 5 4215 FSA`

**Line format**
:   `prefix node-name time flow_start_time flow_end_time src_ip:src_port->dst_ip:dst_port protocol payload destination-name flow-size(in packets) flow-size(in bytes) protocol-flags`

After finishing your detection algorithm(s), the last thing you need to do
is add the corresponding class name to `detector_map` in `ROOT/Detector/gad/Detector/API.py`. After that you will be able to use your
detection algorithm(s). You can use `detectcompare` experiment to compare with
other algorithms or `eval` algorithm to Evaluate your algorithm(s). You
can also implement new experiment to play with your new algorithm(s).

#### Use Other Flow Records

SADIT does not only support the text output format of [fs-simulator](http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf), but
also several other types of flow data. The data wrapper classes are defined in `sadit.Detector.gad.Detector.Data` module and the handler classes locate in the `sadit.Detector.gad.Detector.DataHandler` module.


In order to use data in a new format, you need to implement two new classes: 


First, a data class that satisfies Data interface (`Data.py`, Line 9). Namely, such a class has to at least provide the following three functions:
* `get_rows`: row slicing
* `get_where`: get range of rows that satisfies a criterion. 
* `get_min_max`: get min and max values of a certain feature at a certain range. 

The package has included several data classes, which all locates in `Data.py`. In some cases, you can re-use existing classes.

* `MEM_DiskFile`: base class for disk file data. 
* `MEM_FS`: disk file generated by [fs-simulator](http://cs-people.bu.edu/eriksson/papers/erikssonInfocom11Flow.pdf).
* `MEM_FlowExport`: disk file generated by FlowExport tool
* `MySQLDatabase`: base class for data in disk file. 


Second, a data handler class that implements data preprocessing, e.g., quantization.


* `QuantizeDataHandler`: will quantize the input data.
* `IPHanlder`: for logs with IP addresses. It will first cluster IPs and replace IPV4 with `(cluster label, dist to cluster center)` pair.


Then you just need to add your `data_handler` to
`data_handler_handle_map` defined in `ROOT/Detector/gad/Detector/API.py`



Videos
------

I have recorded several hand by hand video tutorials for SADIT 1.0. The
usage of SADIT 1.1 is a little bit different, but I think these
videos will still be useful. I will record new videos for the latest version
of SADIT when I have time.
